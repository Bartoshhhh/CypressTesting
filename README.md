# Automated Tests in Cypress

This repository contains automated tests written in Cypress for a simple free e-commerce system I found online, specifically for the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/index.html) website.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Cypress

## How to Set Up

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. After configuring your Cypress environment, drag and drop the test files into the '/e2e' folder.
3. Drag and drop the following test files into the /e2e folder:
   - T001 - T004 (Hamburger menu).cy.js - Tests related to the hamburger menu functionality.
   - T005 - T021 - Functionality.cy.js - Tests for various functionalities of the Sauce Demo website.
4. Run the tests in Cypress from the /e2e folder.

## Test Scenarios

I have also included a file named **Test Cases - Swag Labs.xlsx**, which contains the detailed test scenarios I used to create the automated tests. These scenarios provide the basis for the automated tests and cover various aspects of the Sauce Demo website's functionality.
